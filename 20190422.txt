Yo my rapidly rapping rhymes are ready,
The T may be yo father,
But the D is yo daddy,
Steady, as river, i delivery
rhyme-crime, at prime-time,
and booze for your liver,
eventhoug i am white i rap like a nigger,
well, a shiver runs down my back,
cause life may be meaningless, 
you better run a check,
but dont turn you back, on me,
cause the D is coming from behind,
yeah to spread yo feet, and take the lead,
this may sound gay, but this is your defeat!




You donno how mad it is,
so show me these damn tiddies,
Cause if you only got A,B or C cups,
you get outscaled by The D, yo nigga thats up,
for my chest is wide, with lots of stripes,
thats what all the girls like.
