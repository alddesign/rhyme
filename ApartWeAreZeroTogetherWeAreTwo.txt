As life goes on,
as the time passes,
i see how i was wrong,
my faith didnt lasted, the fastest, 
decision was made to in hurry,
damn, i was dumb and my sight was blurry,
i thought you were you were just ok,
but let me get this of my chest:
if you ask 'was i a good girl?', 
i´d say no,
you were da best.
I am taking over from now on,
as battle rages, we need to go on,
from now on forever,
hand in hand together,
it doesnt matter whether,
you´re strong or sooth like a feather,
whenever, whereever i wont let you down - never.
They´re afraid of the horns,
seeing them as thorns,
makes me feel worn-off and torn,
please keep we warm in this storm,
that is all around - and snow keeps falling,
will you answer, when am calling,
as the nights so cold and dark, 
my dearling do you hear me, 
it is breaking my heart.
You were the first one,
no the only - you hear me, 
you´re the one who didnt fear me,
in the franxx,
in the snow,
your took my hand,- and shed your tears for me,
like you shed your blood just, damn, to save me.
So help me please, just one more time,
i flipped a dime, a thousand times,
with the same damn result, everytime
i am yours and you are mine.
I am not gonna write it,
now its up to you,
shout it out loud,
My name, its .... ...






































...yeah cause apart we are zero, togehter we are two.
Maybe thats the origin of my name...
