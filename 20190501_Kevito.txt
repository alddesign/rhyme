Yo Keviko-chan this is your chance for a new beginning,
like kirito-san from SAO keeps on winning,
the idea is to start a new lifestyle,
with a clean room, gaming, and japanese artstyle,
dont lock the door, because you dont have one,
sleep on the floor, because thats how shits done,
order no whore, cause in that theres no honor and no fun,
ao run, get all your shitty cosplay stuff,
so you´re telling me seven bras are not enough!?,
to dress as these chars, you must be really though
so good luck when get stuck in thight stockings and mike needs a f*ck.
Lets wrap this up, right to the beat,
clap your hands, thats a good deed,
and kill every spider, 
after the hunt, kill the pain with some cider.
and when you´ve finished every damn web-creature,
its time to install every damn weeb-feature,
smash zero two,... yeah onto the wall,
pin her, frame her, make sure she doesnt fall,
goddamn there´s no one like her at all.
Play some piano, soft as a feather,
anime, fairy tail, or whatever,
or dress your self in latex and leather,
and make some guys horny, please take off the sweater,
but keep in mind that oppai size matters.
Last but not least, 
if you meet me on the street,
you are either a weeb,
or want to buy hentai, furries or weed.
