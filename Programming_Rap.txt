Programming Rap:

I code really clean an damn fine,
the chache is empty, every var is defined,
sometimes i break a line into two,
with decimal places zero or two,
check that, you dumbass, your fool,
i am fast like a hashmap,
only thing you can type is a hashtag,
you simply cant match that,
i really wish i could return(); that favor,
but sometimes try,catch is your only savoir,
yeah,
there are many ways to destroy a database,
you managed to do all of them, in just three days,
disgrace, 
your even define a goddamn classname in lowercase.
Check yo resolution nigger, it aint that hard,
cause it seems to me you cant CSharp, 
i bash you back to the commandline, 
JS, SQL in Adobe CS9.
You cant even do simple string split,
make your testamony and your last git commit,
when i kill you its like a transaction without a rollback,
braking your neck with every tool from backtrack,
i dont only flip the heap but also the stack.
What else there is to say?
your code is gay and unstable,
to complie it wont be able,
your fat ass doesnt even fit into a motherfucking one TB rainbow table.
die();
