THE ENVIOUS WITCH

The envious witch plead,
to come by the other day,
legit´s my visit,
cause vision´s explicit,
cleavage, behold, 
so darkness unfolds.

judged by your deeds
all moral discarded,
thou thoughts art lewd,
and with flesh rewarded
a lil childs mind, in heat distorted

two of a kind, they say
not difference be found,
two of a kind, it seems,
agreement be done,
two of a kind, indeed,
though desperately needed,
wise man´s words,
remain unheeded

Colors start fading,
strength gaining grayscales,
ligth tries to blind me,
and light i am fighting,
light was the burden,
and by goes the day,
the moon´s glowing gloomy,
yet nightfall awaits

You cant blame the cat, 
shes jus' a silent observer,
not the glance of a chance to-- withstand,
now we serve her,
meow might be good,
meow meow means murder 
dont mind,...
this fucking fur any furhter,
this fucking fur is a hurdle

Calmingly choosen the last words have been,
to lighten you mood, - just slightly,
